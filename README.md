## Minimal Language Model

This repository implements a minimal language model to educate myself on the topic. It is largely based on the amazing tutorials of [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy).

Next steps:
- Make use of torch's flash attention and search for further suboptimalities
- Build a new sota tokenizer
- Apply further tricks from nanogpt
- Train on a larger dataset
