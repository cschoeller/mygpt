## Minimal Language Model

This repository implements a minimal language model to educate myself on the topic. It is largely based on the amazing tutorials of [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy).

Next steps:
- Enable special characters in tokenizer
- Apply further tricks from nanogpt (+ Relu2, Rotationary Embeddings)
